Hostel Hub is a web application designed to streamline the process of booking hostel rooms for
college students. Our website not only eases the process of booking hostel rooms for college
students but also improves the administrative efficiency of hostel management. Hostel Hub,
with the help of its intuitive UI and amazing features, offers students the convenience of
browsing, booking, and managing accommodation online. Our system provides the
administrators with the tools to manage room availability, handle reservations, manage and
check the details of students, and much more. Hostel Hub provides a smooth gateway for
college students to book hostel rooms of their choice hassle-free. 

Hostel Hub solves several key problems faced by both college students and admins:
- Due to no college hostel booking system, students donâ€™t get the room of their wish.
- During admission time, hostel admins have to deal with a lot of booking requests, room
allocations and student management tasks. Hostel Hub automates all the administrative tasks
like managing room availability, handling booking requests, checking student details etc.
- Keeping track of room availability and occupancy status is a major challenge for hostel
administrators, leading to overbooking or underutilization of hostel facilities. Hostel Hub
provides real-time updates on room availability, allowing administrators to efficiently manage
room allocation and optimize hostel occupancy.
